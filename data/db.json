Placed at the end of blog posts, this widget allows viewers to replicate her look. And with Pinterest's Save buttons hovering over each picture, fans can keep her glamorous aesthetic on hand for inspiration. ",

      "body": "What is a blog, anyway? There’s more than one way to answer that question, and Lizzy Hadfield provides an especially photogenic one. This fashion blog example serves as the visual diary of a stylish fashionista and marketing influencer. \n\nArranging her images and posts in a grid website layout, Lizzy fills up the screen with softly colored photographs that retain a cohesive visual language. This layout looks just as great on her mobile website, too, with the different posts compiled into one long, full-screen scroll.\n\nIn addition, she uses her blog as a tool to promote her social media accounts and build engagement with her brand. In the menu bar at the top, she has a separate section called Follow that links directly to her Instagram, YouTube and Twitter pages.",
